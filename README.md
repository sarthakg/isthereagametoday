Should I take 237 today?

This is a take on the "Is there a giants game today?" website but catered towards those who take 237 for their daily commute. It is bad enough driving on 237, heavens forbid if there is an event at Levi's stadium. 

For now I haven't found a straightforward way of scraping the events schedule but will keep it updated for as long as I can. Also added a secondary screen for viewing Traffic to drive through 237 (from one end to another) using Google's map API.
